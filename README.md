# EDA-on-iris-dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The analysis explores relationships between features and visualizes how different species are grouped based on petal and sepal characteristics. This also includes the reason why each packages are imported and each graphs are used, along with interpretations from the charts.
